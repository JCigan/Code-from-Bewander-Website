<!-- This is some small code that I placed on the Bewander
home page in order to disable the scroll bar from appearing
on the page on smaller screens. Previously, several other
developers had failed to address the problem - this code
immediately prevented the site's logo from scrolling up and
down when the mouse wheel or scroll buttons were used. -->
